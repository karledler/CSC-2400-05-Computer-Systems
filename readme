Assignment #2

	I used piazza questions as a reference of how my code should be
handled. I also asked a question on piazza, and I recieved a helpful answer.

Adding up all the hours I worked on this program, it probably took me about
half of day to completely finish it.

I enjoyed the assignment, I needed a refresher on my coding techniques.
It was not too difficult, but it involved 3 files and
testing was really important for finding errors.

I believe my program works correctly. It did not crash when executed.
I checked to make sure it was printing out the correct parts of the array.
The only issue I had involved a segmentation fault error which I cleared up.
Also, I misspelled stringarray as stingarray. Hopefully that doesn't cause any confusion.
